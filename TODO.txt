General
=======
1. Define/Refine requirements with prototype.
2. Add documentation.

Code cleanup
============
1. make sure that the comments are uniform in the emv.py module.
2. for financial related function that need body, change the function
signature to accept a list of bytes instead of a sting?  

Technical
=========
1. refactor the code to put Card object in terminal.py and rename the card
object a terminal. It makes more sense to call the object Card, an object
Terminal since it's always the terminal that issue commands.

2. keep in EMV only the functions that can be used on Terminal response (e.g:
parse_gpo_resp, parse_alf etc.)

3. create a program/module that reads all public information from the card 
image, that perform certain other transaction related function (e.g:
GENERATE APPLICATION CRYPTOGRAM) and saves the result in JSON to a file.

4. create a package called scenario that provide high level functions
to access card and write test script.

5. Build a report generation engine based on nose/jinja2/mako? for the test 
script.
